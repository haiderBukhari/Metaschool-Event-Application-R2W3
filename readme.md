2.	<span style="text-decoration:underline">***Event Creation:***</span> Develop a form or wizard-like interface for event organizers to create event pages, add event details, set ticket prices, and customize event pages.
3.	<span style="text-decoration:underline">***Ticketing System:***</span> Design a ticketing system for attendees to purchase tickets securely and easily.
4.	<span style="text-decoration:underline">***Event Search and Filtering:***</span> Implement search and filtering options to help users find relevant events based on location, category, date, etc.
5.	<span style="text-decoration:underline">***Event Management:***</span> Build an interface for event organizers to manage their events, track registrations, and make updates to event details.
6. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Analytics and Reporting:***</span> Provide event organizers with analytics and reporting features to track event performance, ticket sales, and attendee engagement.

***üìú Smart contract requirements***

<span style="margin: 20px">***‚ûú. Functional requirements:***</span> 

1. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Integration:***</span> Explore leveraging blockchain technology for aspects such as ticketing, registration, and payment systems. This could involve utilizing smart contracts, decentralized identity, or decentralized storage solutions.
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Tokenization:***</span> Implementing a native token system within the application. Tokens can be used for various purposes such as rewarding attendees, enabling access to exclusive features, or facilitating peer-to-peer transactions.
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Decentralized Storage:***</span> Explore using decentralized storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store event data, images, and other media files. This ensures data availability and reduces reliance on centralized servers.
4. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Interoperability:***</span> Consider how the application can interact with other decentralized applications (DApps) or blockchain networks. This could involve integrating with existing decentralized identity systems or allowing users to connect their wallets from different blockchain networks. (e.g, chainlink)


<span style="margin: 20px">***‚ûú Non-functional requirements:***</span> 

1. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Privacy and Security:***</span> Ensure user data protection and that privacy is maintained within the Web3 environment. Explore encryption techniques and decentralized identity solutions to enhance security.
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***Community Engagement:***</span> Leverage the power of Web 3 technologies to facilitate community engagement and participation. This could involve implementing decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing users to contribute to event planning, or incorporating social features like decentralized
messaging.
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline">***UX/UI Design:***</span> Design the user interface to be seamless and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with blockchain-related functionalities. Consider providing clear instructions and feedback to guide users through the Web3 experience.

3. Smart contract mints non-transferable NFT ticket to attendee wallet after verification.

***Proof of Attendance***

1. After event completion, attendance NFTs are submitted to claim certificates
2. Smart contract verifies ticket validity, destroys NFT from wallet and issues certificate NFT to attendee

***Touchpoints***

- Frontend interacts with blockchain network through Web3 injected provider such as MetaMask and TrustWallet.
- IPFS used for decentralized storage of event media assets
- ERC-721 standard used for NFT generation
